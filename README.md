#Make your GirlFriend Happy by Coding 

I'm always working hard to make my GF happy by offering different surprises. Then I came into several ideas as contained in this repo:
 
1:Stylized Video by Character Padding (Matlab)
by running videoStylize.m. It stylizes an input video by padding ASCII characters in each frame.

2:Fancy Output "ilove you" (Java)
by running Main.java and watch the console output. 

Contact me if you have a better idea or complain if you use the repo and your girlfriend doesnot enjoy it, thru shinydotcom@163.com.

Thx and work hard together!!
